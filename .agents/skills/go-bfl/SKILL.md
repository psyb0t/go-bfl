# go-bfl

Unofficial, typed Go client for the Black Forest Labs FLUX API. Package `bfl` lives at the module root. Read [references/setup.md](references/setup.md) for constructors, operation names and response handling.

## Security and safety

- Load `BFL_API_KEY` from the environment. Send it in `x-key` through `bfl.WithRequestEditorFn`. Never log the key, task IDs or signed output URLs.
- Use `https://api.bfl.ai`. Validate HTTPS and an approved provider host before following a returned `polling_url`; never send the key to an arbitrary URL.
- Submissions spend credits. Delete-finetune changes account state. Call these only for the user's requested action. Do not retry a paid submission blindly.

## When to use

Use for Go code that submits FLUX image or video tasks, uses FLUX tools, polls task status, reads credits or manages fine-tunes. This module is unofficial. For changing the generated client, read the repository's `AGENTS.md`.

## Usage

Follow the compiled submit-then-poll example in the root `example_test.go`, also shown in `README.md`. Construct `bfl.NewClientWithResponses` with the base URL, a request editor setting `x-key`, and a bounded HTTP client.

1. Submit with `FluxPro11V1FluxPro11PostWithResponse(ctx, bfl.FluxPro11Inputs{Prompt: &prompt})`.
2. Check the Go error and `JSON200`, then call `AsAsyncResponse()`. Verify `Id` and `PollingUrl` are nonempty. Webhook submissions use `AsAsyncWebhookResponse()` instead.
3. Poll with `GetResultV1GetResultGetWithResponse(ctx, &bfl.GetResultV1GetResultGetParams{Id: task.Id})`. Use a bounded context and a timer between requests.
4. Decode with `AsResultResponse()` or `AsSettledCostResultResponse()` when the settled cost is needed. Continue for `Pending`, `Reasoning`, `Generating`. Consume `Result` on `Ready`. Treat every other status as terminal or unknown.
5. Inspect untyped result JSON before using any media URL. The client does not download media.

HTTP status failures are responses, usually with nil `JSON200`, rather than Go errors. Inspect `StatusCode()` and `Body`. Union accessors do not validate required fields. Nullable fields are pointers; check them before dereferencing. Costs, credits and progress use `float64`. Keyframe tuples use untyped array elements and need caller validation.
